# My Next.js Project with TypeScript

## Description
This project is a simple Next.js application with TypeScript that demonstrates the setup of a basic functional component, styled with CSS Modules.

## Technical Setup
- **Next.js Setup**: The project was initialized using `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript` command to ensure compatibility with TypeScript.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: TypeScript was configured to ensure type safety for variables and components.

## Code Quality
- **Clarity and Organization**: The code is organized into separate files for components, styles, and pages, following best practices for readability.
- **TypeScript Usage**: TypeScript is used effectively to define types for variables and components, ensuring type safety throughout the project.

## Functional Implementation
- **Welcome Page**: Implemented a functional component in the `pages` directory that displays a welcome message and the current date.
- **Dynamic Date Display**: JavaScript logic is used to display the current date dynamically each time the page is loaded.

## Aesthetic Presentation
- **CSS Modules**: Created a separate CSS module file for styling (`Welcome.module.css`) and applied styles to enhance the visual layout of the welcome page.
- **Styling**: Defined styles for the greeting text and the date, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing presentation.
